# Awesome Channel Points Manager

**Awesome Channel Points Manager** allows you to quickly setup amazing integrations with your games and broadcaster tools.

Automatically update your **Channel Rewards** when you change your game activity to allow your viewers interact with you specifically for the game you play!

Create custom **rewards** interactions with our **plugins** !

Let your viewer change the weather or apply effects on the player in **Minecraft** thanks to our Minecraft plugin, or apply any sound effect like changing your voice pitch, or playing melodies with our **MIDI plugin** and any music software understanding MIDI signals, like **Ableton**!
