# Minecraft Plugin

The Minecraft plugin is a Forge plugin that allows to interact with game through a HTTP API.

The source code is available at [Thyvador/minecraft-http-mod](https://github.com/Thyvador/minecraft-http-mod); it was developed specifically for the project.

You can apply potion effects, either positive ones like regeneration or strength potions or negatives ones like poison or blindness potions.
You can also change the weather in the game and set it to raining, thunder or clear.
